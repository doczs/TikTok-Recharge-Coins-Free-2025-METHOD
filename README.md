TikTok coins are a virtual currency used within the TikTok platform to support creators during live streams. Here's an overview of how they work:

1. Purpose
Support Creators: TikTok coins are primarily used to purchase virtual gifts, which can be sent to creators during their live streams. These gifts can be converted into real money by the creators.
Engagement: They enhance user engagement and offer a way for fans to express appreciation for their favorite creators.
2. How to Buy TikTok Coins
In-App Purchase: Coins can be purchased directly through the TikTok app using real money.
Pricing: The cost of coins varies depending on your region and the number of coins purchased. Larger bundles often come with discounts.
3. Using Coins
Users can exchange coins for virtual gifts, such as emojis or animations like roses, pandas, or luxury items.
These gifts are then sent to creators during their live broadcasts.
Virtual gifts can be turned into diamonds by the creators, which TikTok converts into real-world currency.

5. Conversion for Creators
Creators accumulate "diamonds" from the gifts they receive.
Diamonds can be cashed out, but TikTok takes a percentage of the earnings as a service fee.
6. Rules and Limitations
TikTok coins cannot be transferred between accounts.
They are non-refundable and can only be used within the TikTok platform.
Users must comply with TikTokâ€™s community guidelines and policies regarding virtual items.
7. Concerns and Criticism
Transparency: There are questions about how much creators actually earn after TikTok's cut.
Accessibility: Coins are bought with real money, which may not be accessible to all fans.
Addiction Risk: Critics argue that the gifting system could encourage spending addiction, especially among younger users.
